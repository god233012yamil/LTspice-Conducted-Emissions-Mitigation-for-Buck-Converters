### LTspice LISN Circuit Used To Measure Common Mode (CM) Noise

This circuit is the LTspice LISN circuit  used in this article.
A Line Impedance Stabilization Network (LISN) is a test fixture used in EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) testing to provide a stable and repeatable impedance to the device under test (DUT) and to measure the conducted emissions on the power lines.
When simulating conducted emissions for a buck converter in LTspice, incorporating a LISN model can help predict the emissions and evaluate mitigation strategies.

### Running a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in LTspice

Performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in LTspice allows you to analyze the frequency content of a signal, which is particularly useful for examining harmonics, noise, and other spectral characteristics in your circuits. In our case, the FFT will be used to analyze the Common Mode (CM) Noise. 

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform an FFT in LTspice:

Step 1. Set Up Your Circuit 
Ensure that the circuit is properly configured and that you have defined a transient analysis to capture the signal you want to analyze.

Step 2. Run the Transient Simulation
Run a transient analysis by including the.TRAN directive in your schematic. This analysis will generate the time-domain data needed for the FFT.

Step 3. View the Time-Domain Waveform
After running the simulation, view the time-domain waveform by clicking on the nodes of interest. In the circuits shown in the article, you would click on V1 and V2 to view the voltage across the capacitor.

Step 4. Perform the FFT
Open the FFT Window: Right-click on the waveform viewer and select "View" -> "FFT" from the context menu.

Step 5. Select Waveforms to include in FFT
In the FFT window, select the signals to analyze. Ensure you have the correct waveforms selected (V(v1) and V(v2)).

Step 6. Select Visible Waveforms
In the windows select both signals V(v1) and V(v2)

Step 7. Create the Algebraic Expression for Common Mode (CM) Noise
Use the expression editor and create the algebraic expression: (V(v1)+V(v2))*0.5*1000000
